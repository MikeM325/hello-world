# hello-world
test repository possibly followed by serious ones, but who knows? certainly not me...

hi, my name is Michael Meng, I'm a student in 12th grade in Bremen, Germany, and I'm interested in coding, programming, software development and networking and all that good stuff.
Hope this will help me to gain some knowledge and skills and that I'll be able to practice said skills.
